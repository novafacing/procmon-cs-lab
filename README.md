# Procmon CS Lab

This is a proof of concept I made when I was a UTA in 2019 for a Lab
idea we had for CS252: Systems Programming to have students implement a
process monitor. The real lab ended up being much more involved -- students
implemented graphs of cpu, memory, and network usage, file system disk space,
but I was the lucky volunteer to make sure it was doable by a team of 3 students
in ~3 weeks by doing it myself in 1.
